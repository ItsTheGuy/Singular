<h4 align="center">A unique blockchain made by humanity for humanity</h3>

## Why? 🚀
I didn't have to do anything at the afternoons in one of my holidays, so I started reading about blockchain, and I asked me, why not to make a blockchain?

## The Singular's purpose 🛰
The Singular's purpose is to provide a transparent and at the same time a privacy fully form of money. The Singular's targets are:
- Security
- Privacy
- Ease

## The Singular protocol 🧑‍🚀
This project is the main implementation of the Singular protocol, however you could make your own implementation of the protocol.

The Singular protocol documentation **is not written yet**, because the distributed network is not yet implemented, however you could suggest how the distributed network should be made in the **Discussions**.

## Singular's testnet ⭐️
Singular has a default network which is called **mainSpace**, and it's main purpose is to test the Singular protocol and others implementations of it. As the title says is a testnet, which means that the quantity of coins that are issued are always the maximum amount set.

## Contribution 🌈
You can contribute to make this a better project. If you want to purpose something you could join to the **Discussions**.

## Development log 🧑‍💻
### TODO
- [ ] Implement the distributed network
- [ ] Write documentation for the protocol
